# hello-world

Hello everyone,

I'm working to improve my coding skills as an amateur coder. My
goals are to become fluent in Python, Rust, C, C++, and C# over time.
I hope to have a few projects here soon enough. Please feel free to
comment on any of my code where you see areas I could improve.

Thanks,

<Alex>
